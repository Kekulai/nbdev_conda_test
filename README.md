## Install

``` sh
pip install tutorial_nbdev_conda
```

Actually use conda like the following

``` bash
conda install -c kekulai -c conda-forge -c tmap tutorial_nbdev_conda
```

## Dev

``` bash
nbdev_conda --build_args '-c conda-forge -c tmap' --upload_user kekulai
```

so far You can create a pure conda package by building a meta.yaml file
with the env requirements defined. build it with the depednent channels
install it with the dpeendnent channels removed test.yaml since it
assumes pip install rather than conda. future work can revist a test CI
using conda

## How to use

Fill me in please! Donâ€™t forget code examples:

``` python
bar()
```

    NameError: name 'bar' is not defined
